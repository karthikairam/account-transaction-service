# Microservice: account-transaction-service
This is a demo microservice for account transaction as part of mobile challengers banking - coding interview

### Tech stack used:
1. Java 11
2. Spring Boot 2.4.1
3. Spring REST API (Spring Web)
4. Lombok 1.18.16
5. Spring Data JPA & H2 in-memory database (exposed the client dashboard to see the records)
6. springdoc-openapi-ui - Auto generated API documentation using OpenAPI 3.0 and exposed Swagger UI for the same (Refer the link above)
7. Dockerized (Dockerfile is included and used the latest concept called multi-layered image building for optimized build time)
8. TDD approach using JUnit 5, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test
9. JaCoCo for code coverage

### JaCoCo code coverage is: ``` 100 % ```

### Steps to building Docker Image:
##### Step 1: Enter the project directory, 
    cd <project_directory>

##### Step 2: To clean and package the micro-service locally
    mvn clean package
 
##### Step 3: Build the docker image and store it in a local repository (Dockerfile is there in the root of the directory itself)
    docker build . --tag account-transaction-service

##### Step 4: Run the micro-service as a container in the docker:
    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 account-transaction-service:latest

Note: I have used multi-layered approach in docker and spring.

### OpenAPI 3.0 Documentation URL: 
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config

Note: Also ```postman collection``` has been pushed into repository for your reference.

### In-Memory Database Dashboard:
http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.jsp   

Note: Username and Password for this database can be changed dynamically as I have provided environment variable which will be used inside the application.
